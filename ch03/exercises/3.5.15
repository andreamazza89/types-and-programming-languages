# Question 1

Suppose we add a new rule

  `if true then t2 else t3 --> t3` (E-FUNNY1)

to the ones in Figure 3-1. Which of the boave theorems (4/7/8/11/12) remain valid?

# Answer 1

Let's take one at a time:

3.5.4 - (`if t --> t' and t --> t'' then t' = t''`)
The new rule invalidates a step in the proof, the one where we infer that for
E-IfTrue, the two forms must be the same.
I guess the intuition here is that one could apply either rule for the same instance,
which yields different results.

so NO for 3.5.4


3.5.7 - (every value is in normal form) - I'd say yes, as the new rule does not
'touch' values.

so YES for 3.5.7


3.5.8 - (every normal form is a value)
I think that the new rule does not invalidate the proof, becuase for the form
  `if t1 then t2 else t3` with t1 = true, the argument is that is that t is not
  normal form because we have a match on the E-IfTrue rule - well now we have two
  matches!

so YES for 3.5.8


3.5.11 - (same as 3.5.4 but using multi-step evaluation)

given this is a corollary of the 3.5.4, gonna say NO for 3.5.11


3.5.12 - (termination of evaluation)

The proof is based on the fact that each step reduces the size of the term, which
the new funny rule does, so even though we've removed determinism, programs still
terminate I think.

so YES for 3.5.12

# Question 2
Suppose instead that we add this rule:

```
                   t2 --> t'2
-------------------------------------------------
if t1 then t2 else t3  --> if t1 then t'2 else t3
```

now which of the above theorems remain valid? Do any of the proofs need to change?

# Answer 2
Basically we've added a rule where we evaluate the then clause first, so I guess
the intuition here is that if we can evaluate the then clause, we do that until normal
form and then we do the normal E-IF? though I guess in the absence of some sorta rule
order, we just have ambiguity - as in, which rule should be used given an if-like
term?


3.5.4 - (`if t --> t' and t --> t'' then t' = t''`)
here we need to consider how the new rule affects the argument around the E-IF case.
problem is - I have not understood this part of the proof, so gonna skip this one.


3.5.7 - (every value is in normal form)
again, the new rule does not affect the values

YES for 3.5.7


3.5.8 - (every normal form is a value)
I think the proof still stands using E-IF, but we need to add a new case for E-Funny2.
I guess the only case we care about if when t2 is not a vale, which, by the hypotesis
means that it is not normal form, so we are able to evaluate it as t2 --> t'2
Now this means that the new rule applys, making it not normal form.

YES for 3.5.8


3.5.11 - (same as 3.5.4 but using multi-step evaluation)


3.5.12 - (termination of evaluation)
same argument as exercise 1: the new rule also decreases size.

YES for 3.5.12
