# Question
Show that the small-step and big-step semantics for this language coincide.

# Answer
I guess case analysis it is again.

---------
-- Values
For values, there are no rules that apply in small-step, so they are the end-state of the
evaluation, which is pretty much the definition of B-VALUE.

--------
-- If/Else

let's take `t` as the term `if t1 then t2 else t3`

when t1 is true/false, then we have direct equivalence with B-IFTRUE/IFFALSE

OK - I give up :(
