# Question
Show that the sets Si are *cumulative* - that is, that for each i we have

Si ⊆ Si+1

# Answer
Let's get the definition:

S0 = {}

Si+1 =   {true,false,0}
       ∪ {succ t1, pred t1, iszero t1 | t1 ∈ Si}
       ∪ {if t1 then t2 else t3 | t1,t2,t3 ∈ Si}

So first S0, which is the empty set, so it is a subset of any other set.

The set of constants is in all the following 'generations'.

For the second and third lines ({succ t1 ... and if/then), because these elements are built on the previous set,
each new set will contain the same elements and add more.

Not sure this is very rigorous, gonna take a look at the solution now.
