# Question
Rephrase definition 3.5.9 as a set of inference rules

# Answer
I think this is basically putting the if above a line and the then below it?

Like (T is the set of all terms)

```
    ∀t ∈ T, t -->* t

    t -->  t'       t -->* t'   t' -->* t''
    --------        ----------------------
    t -->* t'              t -->* t''
```

where I guess the top one is reflexivity and the last one transitivity?
