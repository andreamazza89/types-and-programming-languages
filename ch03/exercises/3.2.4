# Question
How many elements does S3 have?

# Answer
I'm tempted to just count it.

My intuition is that there might be some kind of formula to calculate how many elements each
'generation' adds once from S4 onwards. But I'm not gonna investigate that.

Ok, so we have

S0 - 0
S1 - 3
S2 - 39
S3 - 59439

Right, maybe I did find out how to figure out the number in the next generation, it seems to be

3
  + succ*(total in previous gen)
  + pred*(total in previous gen)
  + iszero*(total in previous gen)
  + if/then-(total in previous gen) to the power of three

mmm I initially thought the if/then would be the permutations of the previous generation, whereas the
book's solution is the cube - trying to understand why.
I guess one first thing to notice is that t1,t2,t3 in the if/then/else can all be the same, so it's not just
the permutations but other triplets, like true,true,true, and true,true,false - wonder if there's a combinatorial
name for something like this.
Ok, I didn't find a name than permutations with repetition, but the idea is that for every element of the term, you
have n options (n being the total of the previous gen), so given that there are 3 elements you take n choices
for the if, times n for the else, times n for the then, giving us cube.
