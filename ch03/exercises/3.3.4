## Induction on Depth

> if, for each term `s`,
>     given `P(r)` for all `r` such that `depth(r) < depth(s)
>     we can show `P(s)`,
>  then `P(s)` holds for all `s`

Meaning that if a certain property holds for a term at a certain depth, if we can
show that it still holds at a deeper level, then it always holds.

~ is this is a bit meta? as in, are we trying to show that induction works by using an
~ inductive proof?

maybe it's some sort of case analysis?

I feel like for constants and succ/pred/iszero, this is simply true in a very similar way to mathematical induction:
if the property holds at a certain depth, and we show that it's true at a 'higher' depth, then we create a sort of
'infinite chain' of proofs: say the thing is true at depth 1, because we also proved that it's true at a higher depth
we can say that it's true at depth 2, now that we now that it's true at depth 2, we rinse/repeat and could go forever.

For if/then/else, this also works, though does not guarantee that we are covering all `s` terms, as we might be 'jumping'
a few. However, the above terms 'grow' by one, so the two together should cover all terms.

Wow this feels very brittle/informal...gonna look at the solution now.

Well, it wasn't too far off I think? they define a new predicate based on natural numbers, representing the depth of
the term, then say that this is basically natural number induction.

The other two use a similar mechanism so won't go through them.
