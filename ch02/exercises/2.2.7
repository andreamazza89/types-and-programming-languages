# Question
Here is a more constructive definition of the transitive closure of a relation R.
First, we define the following sequence of sets of pairs:

  Ro     = R
  Ri+1   = Ri U {(s,u) | for some t, (s,t) ∈ Ri and (t,u) ∈ Ri}

  R+ = Ui Ri
    (the union of all Ri)

# Answer
Much like the previous exercise, the above seems to be a recipe for taking a relation R (that
is not transitive) and building its transitive closure.

Not going to attempt a formal proof, but work through an example.

The first two definitions above describe a step in adding pairs towards transitivity.
Let's take a relation R as {(s,t), (t,u), (u,p)}

To visualise what the definition above does, is it takes one element that exists in two pairs, and
then adds a pair with the remaining two:

  {(s,t), (t,u), (u,p)}
      ^----^                 (add (s,u))
             ^----^          (add (t,p))

so now we have {(s,t), (s,u), (t,u), (t,p), (u,p)}. Doing the step again

  {(s,t), (s,u), (t,u), (t,p), (u,p)}
      ^-----------^                 (nothing to do (s,u) already exists)
             ^------------------^   (add (s,p))
                    ^-----------^   (nothing to do (t,p) already exists)

which gives {(s,t), (s,u), (t,u), (t,p), (u,p), (s,p)}. Trying the step again leaves the set unchanged.
The step we take guarantees transitivity as it's the definition of transitivity (for every two pairs
sharing a 'middle' element, create a new relation between the 'outer' elements).

So the union of al Ri eventually makes a starting relation transitive and stops adding new pairs (kinda like
a fix point?), so the result is transitive, contains the original relation and is as small as it could be.
