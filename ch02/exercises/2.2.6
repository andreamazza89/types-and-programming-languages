# Question
Suppose we are given a relation R on a set S. Define relation R' as follows:

  R' = R ∪ {(s,s) | s ∈ S}

That is, R' contains all the pairs in R plus all the pairs of the form (s,s).
Show taht R' is the reflexive closure of R.

# Answer
Given the definition of a reflexive closure

> the smallest reflexive relation R' that contains R
(R being a binary relation on a set S)

So, first of all, for R' to be reflexive, it needs to contain {(s,s) | s ∈ S}.

To be the reflexive closure if also needs to contain R, so the union between the
two (R ∪ {(s,s) | s ∈ S}) forms a reflexive closure.

In fact, this is the recipe for making a reflexive closure: take a binary relation
R on set S, and make the union with all the reflexive pairs of S.
