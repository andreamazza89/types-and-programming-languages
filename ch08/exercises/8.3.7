mmmm trying to understand the question;

I guess formalizing the intuitive property of type safety means proving that a given well-typed term
is also not stuck? But that's almost definitely not the answer as it's exacly the same as what we have
for the standard one. Like it's similar proofs but with more rules to tackle.

And I guess another thing is that preservation is no longer needed since any given evaluation rule just
shortcuts to a value?
