# Question
Why is using a `try` handler in a recursive loop not a very good style in ML?

# Answer
My first instinct is that it's much more deliberate/clear to describe the potential for a missing rule
in the type: instead of 'promising' that evaluating will always return a term, it's better to use
something like a Maybe. This way any clients will be forced to consider 'stuck' terms within their programs.

Well, though I still agree with my argument above, it's more about 'style', whereas the answer was around the fact
that adding `try` makes the recursive call not tail-recursive.
