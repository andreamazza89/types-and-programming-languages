I guess this is like inlining?

Instinctively this feels fine, I struggle to see what the problem would be, but maybe I should
try dig deeper both in terms of evaluation as well as typing.

In terms of evaluation, perhaps this changes the order? Cause with the let rules, we first evaluate the binding
to a value, and then proceed, whereas with the suggested form, we might end up evaluating it later.

For example in let x=<some term not in normal form> in <some other term not in normal form> x, with the suggested
strategy we end up evaluating the <some other term> first. Is this a problem? I cannot see why/how.

In terms of typing I cannot think of any difference, but I am sure I miss a ton of nuance.
