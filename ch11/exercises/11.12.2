To answer, I think I am going to look at each typing rule to see if the annotation is needed.

T-NIL  | I think this is necessary, cause there is nowhere else to get the info.
T-CONS | I think from this we can infer that it's not necessary in cons, because we can get the info from the two terms
... In fact, I suspect all other rules can just get the typing information from the terms, so I am going to stop here
    and say it's just nil[T] where we actually need it.
