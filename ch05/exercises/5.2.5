# Question
Use `prd` to define a subtraction function

# Answer
The intuition here for a subtraction of m minus n is to apply `prd` to m n times. It's like taking the
fist number and then repeatedly.

minus = λm . λn . n prd m

something interesting here is that for something like 1 - 9 we just get 0 rather than -8. I guess this
is correct in the domain of positive integers
