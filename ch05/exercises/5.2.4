# Question
Define a term for raising one number to the power of another.

# Answer

I think I could use the definition of multiplication, and define power as multiplying a number by itself
a number of times.

times = λm . λn . λs . λz . m (n s) z

power = λn . λp . p (times n) n    | this does not work

mmm the above doesn't quite work, maybe another angle is to think about the fact n^0 is always 1?

with that in mind, the following shape would work: when p is 0, then the result is 1

power = λn . λp . p _ 1

now can I fill the blank to make this thing work? my intuition is that we are repeatedly applying a function,
the first argument being one. I guess that could be *n?

power = λn . λp . p (times n) 1

Yayyyy - it works!! Is it the same as the solution from the book? yes, one of the two ways

The other way looks cool - I wanna try understand it:

power2 = λn . λp . p n

I struggle to get my head around it: my intuition for a number is to repeatedly do a thing (p in the above)
given a starting point (normally called z). so above we are repeatedly (n times) applying p to what?
Like where does the z? maybe I should try some concrete example by hand, let's do 1 to the 0

    (λn . λp . p n) (λs1 . λz1 . s1 z1) (λs0 . λz0 . z0)
--> (λp . p (λs1 . λz1 . s1 z1)) (λs0 . λz0 . z0)
--> (λs0 . λz0 . z0) (λs1 . λz1 . s1 z1)
--> λz0 . z0

wat - this doesn't look like a Church numeral - gonna abandon this rabbit hole
