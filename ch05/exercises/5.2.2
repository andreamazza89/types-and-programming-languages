# Question
Find another way to define the successor function on Church numerals.

# Answer

Well, the 'shape' is a function that takes in a numeral and returns another numeral, like
(couldn't figure it out - in the end I gave up)

位n . ___n + 1___

位n . 位s . 位z . n s (s z)


ooooooo ok - so instead of saying 'add one to whatever n is' (my intuition for the definition on the book)
we 'count up' to n from 1 instead of 0, so that we end up to n+1.

I think this develops my intuition for numerals as more of a counting up to a number than repeating a number
n times.
