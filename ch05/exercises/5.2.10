# Question
Define a function `chruchnat` that converts a primitive natural number into the corresponding Church numeral.

# Answer
Ok, this probably needs recursion, as we build up the church numeral while we go through the primitive one.

The primitive one looks like `succ (succ (succ 0))`

I guess we could start from the base case and say that if it's 0 then we're done, otherwise we go again
adding one?

convert = λrecur . λn . if (iszero n) then c0 else (scc (recur (prd n)))
churchnat = fix convert
