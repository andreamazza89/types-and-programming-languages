# Question
Is it possible to define multiplication on Church numerals without using `plus`?

# Answer

(Maybe one way to do this is if we had recursion, though I doubt this is the answer given recursion is
introduced in a little bit)

The definition of m*n using plus applies `plus n` to the literal `zero` for m times.

I wonder if instead we could say that m*n just does the `n s z` thing m times?

λm . λn . λs . λz . ...

Ok - I give up, I'm lost here, gonna peek at the solution

dang, I feel like I was close with that intuition, the answer in the book is

λm . λn . λs . λz . m (n s) z
