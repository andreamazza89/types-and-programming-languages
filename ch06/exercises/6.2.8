# Question
The definition of substitution on nameless terms should agree with our informal defintion of substitution
on ordinary terms.

1. What theorem needs to be proved to justify this correspondence rigosously?
2. Prove it.

# Answer
So, how do we prove that substitution on ordinary terms is equivalent to substitution using nameless ones?

I'm kinda lost so will look at the solution :(

Ok, so it formalises the intuition that for any given term t, the substitution [x-->s]t made nameless using
removenames([x-->s]t) should equal the same operation where each element is made nameless.

well the solution only hints at the proof rather than spell it out, so gonna not dwell on this too much!
