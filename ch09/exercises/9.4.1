I think that T-IF is a creation rule, as we 'consume' a Bool to create a type T

The other too are either neither creation/elimination or maybe creation, I feel the former is right.

For Nat I think that T-ZERO is similar to the line just above this one, whereas the other ones are
all elimination as they kinda 'consume' a type?
