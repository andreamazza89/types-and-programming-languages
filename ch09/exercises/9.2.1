Struggling to understand the question: what are 'base' types?

aaaa ok I think I get it (after looking at the solution), and I was acutally wondering about this
while looking at figure 9-1: the syntax for a type (T), is defined in terms of itself but there's no base
case, so it's impossible to build a valid type, which makes it *degenerate*.
