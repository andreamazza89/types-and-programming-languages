# Types and programming languages
My notes and exercises for [this book](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)

## Running code
I use Haskell for any exercises that involve coding.

## Note conventions

- A direct quote from the book look like this:
> A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of centrain
> program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they
> compute.

- A comment/thought of mine is prefixed by a `~`.

- Something I cannot wrap my head around is prefixed by a `~?`
